# Don't Not Live
Repo for my personal project. Created with Unity using C#. It is a boss rush where the bosses have bullet hell attacks, the player is affected by gravity, you can restart instantly between attempts, and instead of having to hold down the attack button to shoot continuously like in some bullet hell games you have a melee attack.

To try it out open "dont not live build" read the controls and run dont not live.exe
